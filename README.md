OCR and Document Search Web Application
Project Description
The OCR and Document Search Web Application is a web-based tool designed to extract text from images containing Hindi and English text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It allows users to upload images via a URL, processes the images using a pre-trained OCR model, and displays the extracted text. The application also features a keyword search function, enabling users to search for specific words within the extracted text. Built using Python, Huggingface Transformers, and Gradio, this project provides a simple interface for extracting and searching text from multilingual images.
